# Image-Memorability-
Memorability measures how easily an image is to be memorized after glancing


# Overview


ResNet-18 is a specific variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture, which is known for its effectiveness in training very deep neural networks. ResNet-18 is relatively lightweight compared to deeper versions like ResNet-50 or ResNet-101. It was introduced by Kaiming He et al. in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition".

The LaMem database is a dataset used in research related to image memorability. It was created by researchers at La Sapienza University of Rome. The dataset contains a collection of natural scene images, and each image is associated with a memorability score, indicating how memorable the image is perceived to be by human observers.

Research Application: LaMem is commonly used in research related to image memorability prediction. It serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the effectiveness of different models and features in predicting image memorability.
